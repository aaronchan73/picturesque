## Inspiration
Picturesque is designed to help readers with ADHD and dyslexia, who often face unique challenges when engaging with text. For those who struggle with focus, retention, or decoding words, our app uses AI to generate custom visuals for each page. These vivid, context-aware illustrations enhance comprehension, reduce cognitive load, and make stories more engaging and accessible.

## What it does
Users can enjoy their favorite books using Picturesque as an ePub reader. For each page, we generate an image to help visualize the story, allowing for an immersive yet unique experience with every read. 

## The Problem
- 70%-80% of individuals who have poor literacy and reading skills come from dyslexia (Sedona Sky, 2024)
- Up to 50% of children with ADHD disabilities experience reading difficulties (Caddac, 2021)

## Why it works
- It takes only a few seconds for children with ADHD to learn from images and visuals, but several minutes from listening to someone speak (Child1st)
- Multisensory structured literacy is one of the most effective approaches to teaching individuals with dyslexia (SedonaSky)
- Children with ADHD enhance comprehension and engagement through visual cues, and interactive materials (Frolli et al.)

## How we built it
- Frontend: React, Vite, Bootstrap ðŸŽ¨ <br/>
- Backend: Python, Flask, DALL-E, Samba Nova âš¡ <br/>
- Storage: Pinata ðŸŽ‰ <br/>

## Challenges we ran into
- No Python SDK for Pinata :(

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Created end-to-end full-stack application :D

## What we learned
- New tools and APIs (thanks Pinata + Samba Nova!)

## What's next for Picturesque
- Library for previously read books <br/>
- Better text separation (e.g. chapters, sections, etc.)
