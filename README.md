# Picturesque
## Inspiration
Picturesque is designed to help readers with aphantasia, the inability to visualize images in the mind. By using AI to generate custom visuals for each page, the app brings text to life through vivid, context-aware illustrations that fill in the mental gaps.

## What it does
Users can enjoy their favorite books using Picturesque as an ePub reader. For each page, we generate an image to visualize the story, allowing for an immersive experience while reading.

## How we built it
- Frontend: React, Vite, Bootstrap ðŸŽ¨ <br/>
- Backend: Python, Flask, DALL-E, Samba Nova âš¡ <br/>
- Storage: Pinata ðŸŽ‰ <br/>

## Challenges we ran into
- No Python SDK for Pinata :(

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Created end-to-end full-stack application :D

## What we learned
- New tools and APIs (thanks Pinata + Samba Nova!)

## What's next for Picturesque
- Library for previously read books <br/>
- Better text separation (e.g. chapters, sections, etc.)
